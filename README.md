# Voltage measurement
A simple program that checks the voltage of a battery when it is connected to the analog pin on an Arduino. A green LED will turn on if the voltage is equal to or above 1.5, else a red LED will turn on. It will also send the voltage value via a serial connection to the computer that powers the arduino
